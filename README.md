# KDTree with visualization using iced

![demo.avif](./docs/demo.avif)

This project is an implementation of the [KDTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) data structure.
It offers a visualization through [`iced`](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/).
The implementation is not meant to be the most performant or generic implementation.

## Compilation

Make sure you have installed [`Rust`](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) on your machine:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `cargo clean` to remove artefacts generated by `cargo`.

## Usage

- Left button: it adds a point into the `KDTree` (blue point)
- Right button: it adds a target point (green point) and finds the nearest neighbor point into the `KDtree` (red point)
- Middle button: it removes a point into the `KDTree`

## Local documentation

```bash
RUSTDOCFLAGS="--html-in-header docs/katex-header.html" cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

## Benchmarks

Compilation
```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-A dead_code" cargo run --release --bin benchmark
```
